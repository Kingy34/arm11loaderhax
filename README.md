# What is 'arm11loaderhax'
arm11loaderhax is a a9lh thingy that uses a hidden exploit on the arm11 chip, that sends signal to the arm9. As this is only patchable via hardware, it will work on any version, so you can update without having the doubt that you'll get to install a11lh on that fw. Pretty cool, right?
